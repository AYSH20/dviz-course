**Seeing is believing**

As our brain tries to integrate information from multiple sources and as our
vision is a dominent sensory input, vision can interfere and dominate other
sensory inputs. For instance, what you see can distort what you hear and it's
called the [McGurk Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect).
Probably more striking example is so-called [rubber hand
illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk).

Apparently, it is very easy to create an illusion that a crude rubber hand is yours. 

**Bad visualizations**

There have been a lot of bad data visualizations from News media. They seem to decrease as data visualization is highlighted more and more. But still you will be able to find some glaring errors in data visualizations in news. For instance, 

- [Unemployment rate under president Obama](http://flowingdata.com/2011/12/12/fox-news-still-makes-awesome-charts/)

**Correlation != causality and visualization often gives fall impression**

![xkcd: correlation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)
*[xkcd: Correlation](https://xkcd.com/552/)*

As this comic beautifully captured, the correlation does not guarantee causation, but the fact is usually not very intuitive to many people. First of all, if you have a lot of numbers, it is very easy to conjure spurious correlations.

On the following website, you can find really weird and hillarious correlations that do not make any sense. 

- [Spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) 
- [Correlation or Causation?](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/correlation-or-causation-12012011-gfx.html)

And then, it is often not easy to realize the existence of potential **[confounding variables (factors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)**.
