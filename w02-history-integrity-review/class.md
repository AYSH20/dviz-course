## Seeing is believing

As our brain tries to integrate information from multiple sources and as our
vision is a dominent sensory input, vision can interfere and dominate other
sensory inputs. For instance, what you see can distort what you hear and it's
called the [McGurk Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect).
Probably more striking example is so-called [rubber hand
illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk).

Apparently, it is very easy to create an illusion that a crude rubber hand is yours. 

## Bad visualizations

There have been a lot of bad data visualizations from News media. They seem to decrease as data visualization is highlighted more and more. But still you will be able to find some glaring errors in data visualizations in news. For instance, 

- [WTF Visualizations](http://viz.wtf/) 
- [Unemployment rate under president Obama](http://flowingdata.com/2011/12/12/fox-news-still-makes-awesome-charts/)
- [Flowing data: Ugly visualization](http://flowingdata.com/category/visualization/ugly-visualization/)

## Correlation != causation

![xkcd: correlation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)
*[xkcd: Correlation](https://xkcd.com/552/)*

As this comic beautifully captured, the correlation does not guarantee causation, but the fact is usually not very intuitive to many people. First of all, if you have a lot of numbers, it is very easy to conjure spurious correlations.

*[xkcd: Significant](https://xkcd.com/882/)*

On the following website, you can find really weird and hillarious correlations that do not make any sense. 

- [Spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) 
- [Correlation or Causation?](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/correlation-or-causation-12012011-gfx.html)

And then, it is often not easy to realize the existence of potential **[confounding variables (factors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)**. For instance, if there is a [negative correlation between maternal mortality and births by C-sections](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/08/daily-chart-2), it is very easy to fall into a trap to think, "Oh, this indicates that C-section saves lives!" However, if number of C-sections in a country is strongly affected by the wealth of the country, and if the maternal mortality is also strongly affected by the wealth of the country, the negative correlation can be clearly visible **even if** C-section increases maternal mortality slightly! 

With the power of visual images, it is easy to mislead people by showing strong correlation and arguing the existence of causality. 

## There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.

Although I believe that statistics is one of the best tools that we have to make informed decisions, it is still true that you can be fooled by hidden details. The following book explains how one can be fooled by statistics and statistical graphics. This book is concise, witty, and extremely useful!
