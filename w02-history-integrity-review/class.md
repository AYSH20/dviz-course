**Seeing is believing**

As our brain tries to integrate information from multiple sources and as our
vision is a dominent sensory input, vision can interfere and dominate other
sensory inputs. For instance, what you see can distort what you hear and it's
called the [McGurk Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect).
Probably more striking example is so-called [rubber hand
illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk).

Apparently, it is very easy to create an illusion that a crude rubber hand is yours. 

**Bad visualizations**

There have been a lot of bad data visualizations from News media. They seem to decrease as data visualization is highlighted more and more. But still you will be able to find some glaring errors in data visualizations in news. For instance, 

- [Unemployment rate under president Obama](http://flowingdata.com/2011/12/12/fox-news-still-makes-awesome-charts/)

**It is hard to deduce causality and visualization makes it worse**
