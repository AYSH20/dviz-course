**Seeing is believing**

As our brain tries to integrate information from multiple sources and as our
vision is a dominent sensory input, vision can interfere and dominate other
sensory inputs. For instance, what you see can distort what you hear and it's
called the [McGurk Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect).
Probably more striking example is so-called [rubber hand
illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk).
