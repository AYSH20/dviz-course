    "To do this, we first need to read the CSV file. Python provides the [csv](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html) module to read and write CSV files. The [`csv.reader`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.reader) function returns a Python object which will iterate over lines in the given file. Each line is returned as a list of strings, so that we can access a particular column using list index. If we want to ignore the first line, we can use [`islice`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice). It is like slicing a list, but it can slice an iterator (e.g. file stream). For instance, `islice(reader, 0, 5)` means \"give me the first 5 items from the `reader`\". `islice(reader, 1, 5)` means \"give me the 4 items starting from the second item\". \n",
