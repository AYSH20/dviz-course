You will complete two (midterm and final) projects. In the midterm project, you
will perform *exploratory and hypothesis-driven analysis* of complex datasets.
The specific datasets or types of questions will be discussed with Instructors.
For the final project, you will create a webpage that extensively *explain and
communicate* facts and insights that you found in a dataset (can be the dataset
from the mid-term).
