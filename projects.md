The mid-term and final assessment will be project-based. For the mid-term
project, you will perform exploratory data analyses on datasets of your choice

assessment will be about creating web-based explanatory visualization that
communicate insights into datasets (ideally from the datasets that you analyzed
at the mid-term).
