## Mapbox

[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) is a mapping platform. You can use it for developing mobile or web apps, or use it to create geo-visualizations. Create an account, create a project, and play with it. You can display maps in different styles, in different locations, and in different zoom levels. When you click "save", it saves the current view (style, location, zoom level) as the default for your app. 

In "Project" tap, you can see your `map ID`. Copy the code in the `Embed` section somewhere, you can see the following code:

    share.html?access_token=.....'></iframe>

Copy the .... part (the `access token`).
