Although exploratory and explanatory visualizations have slightly different aims—to discover hidden patterns vs. to communicate insights and messages in the data—good exploratory visualizations *explain* what is going on and good explanatory visualizations let people *explore* the ideas. 

Animation and interactivity can be surprisingly effective in explaining complex mathematical concepts or techniques.  For instance, take a look at [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s article ["Explorable Explanations"](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/) (play with the examples), or this amazing projects called ["Explained Visually"](http://setosa.io/ev), which is inspired by the "Explorable Explanations". Here are more of my favorite examples: [Animated Bézier curve](https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/) beautifully explain the algorithm of Bézier curve, which is a popular method to draw arbitrary smooth curves. Mike Bostock, the creator of `D3.js`, made many superb explanatory visualizations including [Visualizing algorithms](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/) where he demonstrate the power of visualization to explains complex algorithms. Here are other great examples:
