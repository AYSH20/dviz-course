\section{Course Description}

From dashboards in a car to cutting-edge scientific papers, from a home office
to the largest companies in the world, we extensively use data visualization to
reveal patterns in data. As our world becomes increasingly connected and
digitized, and as decisions are increasingly driven by data, data visualization
is becoming a critical skill for every knowledge worker. This course is an
introduction to basic data analysis and visualization. We will learn
fundamentals of data visualization in terms of exploratory visualization
(Python stack) and explanatory visualization (Javascript and D3.js).  


\section{Course Objectives}

By the end of the course, you will be able to understand, explain, and handle
numerous types of data, analyze datasets using basic exploratory visualization
techniques, and create simple explanatory web-based visualizations. You will
also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of data visualizations based on the
principles of human perception, design, types of data, and visualization
techniques. 
 

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item Exploratory data visualization and analysis

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Python data analysis stack
%\item Data types 
%\item Loading and manipulating data 
%\item Fundamental data visualizations
%\end{itemize}

%\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:Prerequisites}

This course is open to advanced undergraduate students as well as graduate
students (I590). Because this course extensively uses programming (Python and
Javascript), it is required to have good understanding and working knowledge of
programming. The basic programming courses (I210 \& I211, or equivalent) are
required prerequisites. In addition, I308: ``Information Representation'' is a
recommended prerequisite. It is also highly recommended to have working
knowledge of statistics and web (HTML, CSS, Javascript).

%\end{itemize}

%If you feel comportable with those questions, you will not have difficulties.
Contact the instructor if you are uncertain about your background. 

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

You should attend and engage in every class. There will be reading materials
that you are expected to read \emph{prior} to the class. At the beginning of
each class, there will be an \emph{in-class quiz} based on assigned readings
and materials from previous classes.  

Assignments from classes and labs are integral part of the class. You cannot
pass the class without completing these assignments. 

The mid-term and final assessment will be based on team projects. The choice of
project topic will be guided by the instructors and you have freedom to choose
projects ranging from visualization-driven heavy data analysis projects to
web-based explanatory visualization ones. 

\section{Books and key materials}

There is no required textbook, but the following books and websites are
recommended.

\subsection{Python and data analysis}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \href{http://www.diveintopython3.net/index.html}{Dive Into Python} by Mark Pilgrim (available online): a good Python book. 

\item \href{http://www.learnpython.org}{Learnpython.org}: A web-based interactive tutorial. 

\item \href{http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/}{An introduction to statistics} (with Python) by Thomas Haslwanter (available online): this book uses Python to explain basic statistics. It also contains a succinct tutorial for Python and data visualization using Python. 

\item \href{http://ipython.rossant.net}{Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization} by  Cyrille Rossant: Introduction to IPython as well as lots of advanced analysis 


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Visualization and Design}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \href{http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392142}{The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (2nd ed.)} by E.R. Tufte: one of the foundational book on visualization. It contains a rich set of historical visualization, thoughtful discussion on visualization principles. 

\item \href{http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Knowledge-Anyone-Can-Map/dp/0262028816}{Atlas of Knowledge: Anyone Can Map} by K. BÃ¶rner: this book systematically analyzes vocabularies of visualization with a lot of great examples. 

\item \href{http://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters/dp/1466508914}{Visualization Analysis and Design} by T. Munzner: a nice textbook that covers important topics of visualization. 

\item \href{http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Thinking-Kaufmann-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123708966}{Visual Thinking for Design} by C. Ware: one of the best books on the role of perception in visualization. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{D3.js}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \href{http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray/dp/1449339735}{Interactive Data Visualization for the Web} by Scott Murray

\item \href{https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki}{D3 documentation}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Policies}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{Disabilities.} Every attempt will be made to accommodate qualified
students with disabilities (e.g. mental health, learning, chronic health,
physical, hearing, vision, neurological, etc.). You must have established your
eligibility for support services through Disability Services for Students. Note
that services are confidential, may take time to put into place, and are not
retroactive.  Captions and alternate media for print materials may take three
or more weeks to get produced. Please contact Disability Services for Students
at \url{http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu} or 812-855-7578 as soon as
possible if accommodations are needed. The office is located on the third
floor, west tower, of the Wells Library (Room W302). Walk-ins are welcome 8 AM
to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. You can also locate a variety of campus
resources for students and visitors who need assistance at
\url{http://www.iu.edu/~ada/index.shtml}. 

\item \emph{No electronics---laptops, tablets, and smartphones---may be used in
class}, unless the usage is specifically requested by the instructors.
\href{http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/}{It
has been shown} that using laptops in class is not a good idea, \emph{even if}
you are using it to take notes.  If you must have electronics due to a
disability or other special reasons, please contact the instructor. 

\item \emph{Be honest.} Your assignments and papers should be your own work.
First, if you find useful resources for your assignments, share them and cite
them. If your friends helped you, acknolwedge them. Second, feel free to
discuss both online and offline, but you should not show your code (papers) nor
see other's. Any cases of academic misconduct (cheating, fabrication,
plagiarism, etc) will be immediately reported to the School and the Dean of
Students, following the standard procedure. Cheating is not cool. 

\item \emph{You have the responsibility of backing up all your data and code}.
Always use at least Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Ideally, learn version
control systems and use \url{https://github.iu.edu} or
\url{https://github.com}. Loss of data, code, or papers due to various reasons
(e.g. malfunction of your laptop) is not an acceptable excuse for delayed or
missing submission. 

\item \emph{Inform your excused absences prior to class}. Please contact the
instructor until the previous day for an excused absence.  

\item If you have any issues, don't hesistate to contact me or
\href{http://healthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/index.shtml}{IU's Counseling
and Psychological Services}.
